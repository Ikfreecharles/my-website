# Getting started with Speed Insights

This guide will help you get started with using Vercel Speed Insights on your project, showing you how to enable it, add the package to your project, deploy your app to Vercel, and view your data in the dashboard.

To view instructions on using the Vercel Speed Insights in your project for your framework, use the **Choose a framework** dropdown on the right (at the bottom in mobile view).

## Prerequisites

- A Vercel account. If you don't have one, you can [sign up for free](https://vercel.com/signup).
- A Vercel project. If you don't have one, you can [create a new project on Vercel](https://vercel.com/new).
- The Vercel CLI installed. If you don't have it, you can install it using the following command:

```bash title="Install Vercel CLI"
pnpm i vercel
```

```bash title="or with yarn"
yarn i vercel
```

```bash title="or with npm"
npm i vercel
```

```bash title="or with bun"
bun i vercel
```

## Enable Speed Insights in Vercel

On the [Vercel dashboard](https://vercel.com/dashboard), select your Project followed by the **Speed Insights** tab. Then, select **Enable** from the dialog.

> **💡 Note:** Enabling Speed Insights will add new routes (scoped at`/_vercel/speed-insights/*`) after your next deployment.

## Add `@vercel/speed-insights` to your project

:::note
When using the HTML implementation, there is no need to install the `@vercel/speed-insights` package.
:::

Using the package manager of your choice, add the `@vercel/speed-insights` package to your project:

```bash title="pnpm"
pnpm i @vercel/speed-insights
```

```bash title="yarn"
yarn i @vercel/speed-insights
```

```bash title="npm"
npm i @vercel/speed-insights
```

```bash title="bun"
bun i @vercel/speed-insights
```

## Add the `SpeedInsights` component to your app

### For Next.js (Pages Router)

The `SpeedInsights` component is a wrapper around the tracking script, offering more seamless integration with Next.js.

The instructions differ based on which version of Next.js you're deploying.

Add the following component to your main app file:

```tsx title="pages/_app.tsx"
import type { AppProps } from 'next/app';
import { SpeedInsights } from '@vercel/speed-insights/next';

function MyApp({ Component, pageProps }: AppProps) {
  return (
    <>
      <Component {...pageProps} />
      <SpeedInsights />
    </>
  );
}

export default MyApp;
```

```jsx title="pages/_app.jsx"
import { SpeedInsights } from "@vercel/speed-insights/next";

function MyApp({ Component, pageProps }) {
  return (
    <>
      <Component {...pageProps} />
      <SpeedInsights />
    </>
  );
}

export default MyApp;
```

For versions of Next.js older than 13.5, import the `<SpeedInsights>` component from `@vercel/speed-insights/react`. Then pass it the pathname of the route, as shown below:

```tsx title="pages/example-component.tsx"
import { SpeedInsights } from "@vercel/speed-insights/react";
import { useRouter } from "next/router";

export default function Layout() {
  const router = useRouter();

  return <SpeedInsights route={router.pathname} />;
}
```

```jsx title="pages/example-component.jsx"
import { SpeedInsights } from "@vercel/speed-insights/react";
import { useRouter } from "next/router";

export default function Layout() {
  const router = useRouter();

  return <SpeedInsights route={router.pathname} />;
}
```

### For Next.js (App Router)

The `SpeedInsights` component is a wrapper around the tracking script, offering more seamless integration with Next.js.

Add the following component to the root layout:

```tsx title="app/layout.tsx"
import { SpeedInsights } from "@vercel/speed-insights/next";

export default function RootLayout({
  children,
}: {
  children: React.ReactNode;
}) {
  return (
    <html lang="en">
      <head>
        <title>Next.js</title>
      </head>
      <body>
        {children}
        <SpeedInsights />
      </body>
    </html>
  );
}
```

```jsx title="app/layout.jsx"
import { SpeedInsights } from "@vercel/speed-insights/next";

export default function RootLayout({ children }) {
  return (
    <html lang="en">
      <head>
        <title>Next.js</title>
      </head>
      <body>
        {children}
        <SpeedInsights />
      </body>
    </html>
  );
}
```

For versions of Next.js older than 13.5, import the `<SpeedInsights>` component from `@vercel/speed-insights/react`.

Create a dedicated component to avoid opting out from SSR on the layout and pass the pathname of the route to the `SpeedInsights` component:

```tsx title="app/insights.tsx"
"use client";

import { SpeedInsights } from "@vercel/speed-insights/react";
import { usePathname } from "next/navigation";

export function Insights() {
  const pathname = usePathname();

  return <SpeedInsights route={pathname} />;
}
```

```jsx title="app/insights.jsx"
"use client";

import { SpeedInsights } from "@vercel/speed-insights/react";
import { usePathname } from "next/navigation";

export function Insights() {
  const pathname = usePathname();

  return <SpeedInsights route={pathname} />;
}
```

Then, import the `Insights` component in your layout:

```tsx title="app/layout.tsx"
import type { ReactNode } from "react";
import { Insights } from "./insights";

export default function RootLayout({ children }: { children: ReactNode }) {
  return (
    <html lang="en">
      <head>
        <title>Next.js</title>
      </head>
      <body>
        {children}
        <Insights />
      </body>
    </html>
  );
}
```

```jsx title="app/layout.jsx"
import { Insights } from "./insights";

export default function RootLayout({ children }) {
  return (
    <html lang="en">
      <head>
        <title>Next.js</title>
      </head>
      <body>
        {children}
        <Insights />
      </body>
    </html>
  );
}
```

### For Create React App

The `SpeedInsights` component is a wrapper around the tracking script, offering more seamless integration with React.

Add the following component to the main app file.

```tsx title="App.tsx"
import { SpeedInsights } from '@vercel/speed-insights/react';

export default function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      {/* ... */}
      <SpeedInsights />
    </div>
  );
}
```

```jsx title="App.jsx"
import { SpeedInsights } from "@vercel/speed-insights/react";

export default function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      {/* ... */}
      <SpeedInsights />
    </div>
  );
}
```

### For Remix

The `SpeedInsights` component is a wrapper around the tracking script, offering a seamless integration with Remix.

Add the following component to your root file:

```tsx title="app/root.tsx"
import { SpeedInsights } from '@vercel/speed-insights/remix';

export default function App() {
  return (
    <html lang="en">
      <body>
        {/* ... */}
        <SpeedInsights />
      </body>
    </html>
  );
}
```

```jsx title="app/root.jsx"
import { SpeedInsights } from "@vercel/speed-insights/remix";

export default function App() {
  return (
    <html lang="en">
      <body>
        {/* ... */}
        <SpeedInsights />
      </body>
    </html>
  );
}
```

### For SvelteKit

Add the following code to your root file:

```ts title="src/routes/+layout.ts"
import { injectSpeedInsights } from "@vercel/speed-insights/sveltekit";

injectSpeedInsights();
```

```js title="src/routes/+layout.js"
import { injectSpeedInsights } from "@vercel/speed-insights/sveltekit";

injectSpeedInsights();
```

### For HTML

Add the following scripts before the closing tag of the `<body>`:

```html title="index.html"
<script>
  window.si = window.si || function () { (window.siq = window.siq || []).push(arguments); };
</script>
<script defer src="/_vercel/speed-insights/script.js"></script>
```

### For Vue

The `SpeedInsights` component is a wrapper around the tracking script, offering more seamless integration with Vue.

Add the following component to the main app template.

```vue title="src/App.vue"
<script setup lang="ts">
import { SpeedInsights } from '@vercel/speed-insights/vue';
</script>

<template>
  <SpeedInsights />
</template>
```

```vue title="src/App.vue"
<script setup>
import { SpeedInsights } from '@vercel/speed-insights/vue';
</script>

<template>
  <SpeedInsights />
</template>
```

### For Nuxt

The `SpeedInsights` component is a wrapper around the tracking script, offering more seamless integration with Nuxt.

Add the following component to the default layout.

```vue title="layouts/default.vue"
<script setup lang="ts">
import { SpeedInsights } from '@vercel/speed-insights/vue';
</script>

<template>
  <SpeedInsights />
</template>
```

```vue title="layouts/default.vue"
<script setup>
import { SpeedInsights } from '@vercel/speed-insights/vue';
</script>

<template>
  <SpeedInsights />
</template>
```

### For Other Frameworks

Import the `injectSpeedInsights` function from the package, which will add the tracking script to your app. **This should only be called once in your app, and must run in the client**.

Add the following code to your main app file:

```ts title="main.ts"
import { injectSpeedInsights } from "@vercel/speed-insights";

injectSpeedInsights();
```

```js title="main.js"
import { injectSpeedInsights } from "@vercel/speed-insights";

injectSpeedInsights();
```

### For Astro

Speed Insights is available for both static and SSR Astro apps.

To enable this feature, declare the `<SpeedInsights />` component from `@vercel/speed-insights/astro` near the bottom of one of your layout components, such as `BaseHead.astro`:

```astro title="BaseHead.astro"
---
import SpeedInsights from '@vercel/speed-insights/astro';
const { title, description } = Astro.props;
---
<title>{title}</title>
<meta name="title" content={title} />
<meta name="description" content={description} />

<SpeedInsights />
```

Optionally, you can remove sensitive information from the URL by adding a `speedInsightsBeforeSend` function to the global `window` object. The `<SpeedInsights />` component will call this method before sending any data to Vercel:

```astro title="BaseHead.astro"
---
import SpeedInsights from '@vercel/speed-insights/astro';
const { title, description } = Astro.props;
---
<title>{title}</title>
<meta name="title" content={title} />
<meta name="description" content={description} />

<script is:inline>
  function speedInsightsBeforeSend(data){
    console.log("Speed Insights before send", data)
    return data;
  }
</script>
<SpeedInsights />
```

## Deploy your app to Vercel

You can deploy your app to Vercel's global CDN by running the following command from your terminal:

```bash title="Deploy with Vercel CLI"
vercel deploy
```

Alternatively, you can [connect your project's git repository](https://vercel.com/docs/git), which will enable Vercel to deploy your latest pushes and merges to main.

Once your app is deployed, it's ready to begin tracking performance metrics.

> **💡 Note:** If everything is set up correctly, you should be able to find the `/_vercel/speed-insights/script.js` script inside the body tag of your page.

## View your data in the dashboard

Once your app is deployed, and users have visited your site, you can view the data in the dashboard.

To do so, go to your [Vercel dashboard](https://vercel.com/dashboard), select your project, and click the **Speed Insights** tab.

After a few days of visitors, you'll be able to start exploring your metrics. For more information on how to use Speed Insights, see the [Using Speed Insights documentation](https://vercel.com/docs/speed-insights/using-speed-insights).
